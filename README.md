Application name: Box Keeper
Purpose:
This application is intended to be an organizational solution to help users keep track of and search the contents of their storage boxes.
As someone who has a lot of items in storage, I plan to use this app to inventory my things and find them when I need them.
How it works:
Users can create unlimited “boxes” that have unique names for identification, such as “Box 1” or “Kitchen 2”. Each box contains a list of items that are inside, such as “blue vase,” “car wash soap,” or “pens.” Boxes can also be tagged with user-specified categories, such as “Kitchen,” “Car,” or “Art Supplies.”
Features:
Users can create, edit, and delete each box, as well as the list of items stored inside each box. Additionally, each box can be assigned user-created category labels – as many or as few as the user wants. Users can search for items or filter boxes based on category.
